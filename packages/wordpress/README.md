# Wordpress Data Transformation

## TODO:

- We need a way to assign image IDs, or access images by filename, so it's
  unnecessary to upload all images _before_ creating the page. We should allow
  creating image IDs locally (maybe), then validating they're correctly
  formatted when inserting them into the database (as one option... perhaps).
